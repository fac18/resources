A list of things FAC18 can do to make sure they bond and stuff. 

## Keep Fridays free
Nothing worse than getting to Friday, and everyone decides to go for a drink - but you can't because you've got plans that you're not even that interested in anymore... I would advise, especially for the first few weeks of the course, keeping Fridays open for some spontaneous FAC fun. You don't even need to go to the pub - check with Polly and see if you can stay in the space late - it's better on your wallets/purse strings!

## Have a team calendar - you can create this online (google calendar) or have a physical one - we had both!!

Why? Keeping track of your FAC birthdays (see below) plus all the meetups, hackathons and social events you have is difficult. Have calendar where you can see everything in one place, and share it with everyone else.

## For those of you who don't have birthdays during your time at FAC, choose FAC birthdays.

Why? It's a really nice way to celebrate each other and show someone a bit of attention. Plus you can make it as exciting or low key as you want - we just tend to buy something small - cake, pastries, shortbreads and sing happy birthday to the person. I would recommend doing it as a secret santa or something similar - each person takes it in turns to buy someone else's birthday cake. This way the burden doesn't fall on one person. Also, if you want to avoid having cake like, every week, maybe pair people up for birthdays? And recycle the candles!

## Go to Rowan's.

Why? Because it's so much fun! 

When we went, we had a bowling match for 16 people and then an hour's worth of karaoke. Altogether, I charged everyone £14, which covered both bowling and karaoke, and entry (which is £1 before 8pm). I hadn't realised that the cloakroom was pretty much mandatory and is £1, so either include that in your budgeting, or warn everyone about it (I would just warn everyone instead of trying to pay for everyone). There was about £1.25 left over from each person, which I used to buy communal beer, wine and snacks. We also had dominos beforehand (ew, I know), which we all chipped in £5 for. If you were to do it, I would recommend maybe charging everyone £20 which is Rowan's and dinner included. Also, under 21s technically aren't allowed into Rowan's after 7pm, but if they're in there before that, they can stay until close. We rang up and they said we could bring our under 21 year old in before 7.30pm and it would be no problem, but I would bear this in mind if you have any youngsters among you.

## Do FAC yoga! We try to do 10min videos every day either during lunch or as an enforced break. Check out vinyasa code in my github!

Why? Because a bit of stretching will make you feel way better! You're spending all day hunched over a computer, you'll need to shake things up a bit. It's great team bonding, too.

## Do a country lunch!

Why? Because I'm sure you're all from some pretty cool and different places, which means delicious and different cuisines! What better than to make some of your fav foods and share them with your fav people? Everyone brings a dish or too and you eat them together!
