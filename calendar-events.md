## Meet-ups

Thanks to @teenie-quaggard we already have a full list of meet-ups and workshops that it would be great to go to with a few extras. Please add more as you go through! If you have a meet up that you think would be great but is less techy please just add a theme title.

I would highly recommend creating a meet-up account, if you don't already have one, and adding each of these to the events you follow.
